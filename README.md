# The-Animal-Game

This game is primarily intended to be played while on a roadtrip. The purpose of the game is to spot and count each animal you see from your side of the vehicle only. When an animal is spotted, select the gray button corrosponding to that animal for each representative of that animal you see.

The game functions largely as a calculator to total the values of all the animals selected. The goal of the game is to reach 100 points. The value of each animal varies based on it's scarcity. The specific value for each animal is listed in the table below.

Roadkill cannot be counted for the purposes of this game. Also, there are two non-animal buttons within the game. The button labeled "Man with a white beard" should be selected anytime you are furtunate enough to see a man with a white beard. Fortunate, because seeing a man with a white beard is worth 100 points, and therefore, an automatic win. The button labeled "Cemetary" should be selected anytime you pass a cemetary on your side of the vehicle. Passing a cemetary results in your score going back to zero.

Below are the values/function for each button
